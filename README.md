Very one dimensional mod loader for the game Mewgenics.

This was hastely made with abundant use of AI, I can't promise it will work on every system. Do what you want with it.

Mewgenics loads resources.gpak as a fallback, meaning that folders that are consistent to the expected folder structure will be read first and therefore load into the game.

This code is currently bundled with a texture mod that changes the in game cursor to a different color.
